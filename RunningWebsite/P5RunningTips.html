                1. Focus on Form: Proper running form can make a big difference in efficiency and reduce the risk of injury. Keep your posture upright, engage your core, and ensure your feet land under your hips. Try to maintain a slight forward lean and keep your arms swinging naturally.

                2. Gradually Increase Mileage: Avoid jumping into long runs or adding too much distance too quickly. Follow the 10% rule: increase your weekly mileage by no more than 10% to give your body time to adapt and reduce the risk of overuse injuries.

            <p>
                3. Incorporate Interval Training: Adding interval training, where you alternate between high-intensity bursts and slower recovery periods, can significantly improve your speed and stamina. For example, try sprinting for 30 seconds, then jogging or walking for 1-2 minutes, and repeat.

        <section class="tip">
            <p>
                4. Strength Train Regularly: Strong muscles support better running performance. Incorporate strength training exercises, especially for your core, hips, and legs. Exercises like squats, lunges, and planks can enhance your running efficiency and reduce the risk of injuries.

            <p>
                5. Prioritize Recovery: Rest and recovery are crucial for improvement. Ensure you get enough sleep, stay hydrated, and eat a balanced diet. Stretching and foam rolling can help alleviate muscle soreness and improve flexibility. Make sure to schedule rest days and listen to your body’s signals to prevent burnout or injury.
